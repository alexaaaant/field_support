This is a simple project that displays academies with devices which should be replaced due to wear batteries.

## Project structure and libraries
The application has been developed using a combination of React, Redux, and testing library. These libraries have been carefully selected due to their strong compatibility and seamless integration, which ultimately enhances the scalability of the project. The chosen libraries complement each other effectively, enabling the application to grow and adapt to future requirements with ease.

Moreover, the project structure itself has been designed with scalability in mind. It is not only flexible but also highly readable, making it easier for developers to understand and navigate the codebase. This thoughtful organization allows for the seamless addition of new features, modules, and components, without compromising the overall structure or impacting the readability of the code. Thus, the project structure acts as a solid foundation for accommodating future expansions and enhancements, ensuring that the application remains scalable throughout its lifecycle.

This decision to allocate less time towards CSS styling was made based on a careful consideration of project priorities and resource allocation.

By prioritizing other aspects such as functionality, performance, and overall project structure, I aimed to maximize efficiency and deliver a scalable solution within the given time constraints. While CSS styling is undoubtedly important for the overall user experience, it was deemed more efficient to focus on core functionalities and ensure a solid foundation for future scalability.
